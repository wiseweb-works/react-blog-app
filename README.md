## About The Project

**React Blog App** is a dynamic and responsive blog application that allows users to read and manage blog posts efficiently. The project leverages **React 19** with **TypeScript** for strong type safety and maintainability. Additionally, **TanStack React Query** is used for efficient data fetching and caching, and **Formik** with **Yup** for form validation.

### Features

- **Modern UI**: Styled using **Material UI 6** for a sleek and consistent design.
- **State Management**: Utilizes **TanStack React Query** for efficient data fetching and caching.
- **Form Handling**: Implemented with **Formik** and **Yup** for robust form validation.
- **Routing**: Uses **React Router 7** for seamless navigation between pages.
- **Notifications**: Integrated **React Toastify** for user-friendly feedback messages.
- **Type Safety**: Fully written in **TypeScript** for better maintainability and error prevention.
